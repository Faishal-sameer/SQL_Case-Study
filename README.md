# SQL_Case-Study
SQL is more than just queries—it's about solving real business problems with data. Here's a look at how I tackled my first SQL case study!


📊 Case Study Overview:


Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.
Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

🔧 What I Did

Tools & Techniques:
I used SQL to perform:
✅ Data Cleaning and Transformation.
✅ Aggregations using GROUP BY and HAVING.
✅ JOINS to combine multiple tables.
✅ Analytical functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.


💡 Key Insights:

 📈 Improved sales: Unveiling performance areas that need a boost.
 📉 Optimal inventory management: Keeping stock levels in check.
 🛍️ Enhanced customer experience: Tailoring offerings to customer preferences.
 💰 Increased revenue: Identifying sales opportunities and maximizing profits.
 🔍 Actionable insights: Transforming raw data into actionable strategies.
 

This project has strengthened my SQL skills and boosted my confidence in solving real-world data problems. 💪
